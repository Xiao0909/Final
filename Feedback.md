Does this group's Kanban board reflect a team that is actively working on their project? Yes

 

What do you like about this group's project?

I really like the polish with the styling here. The JavaScript looks relatively clean. I have nitpicks on making it more maintainable, but overall very good.

 

What do you dislike about this group's project and what can they improve on?

Component integration. Not all next buttons are the same. Code style varies in the project. The Pikachu game continues even after you beat it. Rock paper scissors has no stated objective to help the player know what their goal is. Progression is somewhat confusing without being told where to start and that the game requires you run it in a Live Server environment. Opening the HTML files normally does not work when you want to move to the next game, but it works once you figure that out.

 

Do you have any recommendations for this group?

I really like the polish, but when you brought the projects together you lost some of that. I think tightening that up would really help on presentation. Really impressed with this. Touches a lot of JavaScript features, with a lot of stuff not covered in the classroom. I really want to get a student group to review this as I think there will be a lot of take aways.
